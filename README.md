Crystl is a budget maker for the disabled community. It takes into account the user's particular circumstances, and through APIs and AI, makes predictions of factors like the user's taxes and rent if the user doesn't enter it themself.

After the user answers questions about their financial situation, the program generates suggestions for future financial wellness and a pie chart detailing the user's budget.
